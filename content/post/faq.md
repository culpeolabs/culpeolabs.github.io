## Why?
Being happy shouldn't be that hard, `Culpeo Labs` is not about having the most amount of clients or the biggest contracts, but enjoying every project. We love what we do, we love Open Source and we love servers, that's what we are.

## How are you better than "x"?
Probably we are not, but we are different. We believe in failure and learning as much as possible from every little mistake. No blames.

# Is this a Support subscription?
No, we won't be replying to tickets with questions. We will take care of your project and make it run (and keep it running).

## Are you a SaaS?
Yes. No. Kinda. You bring the Infra, we manage it. Let us know what you want to run, or what you are having issues with and we will create an execution plan.

## Do you need access to the servers?
Yes. We will need SSH access to the machines where the services are running. We rely on [Teleport](https://goteleport.com) for secure remote access.

## What Sofware do you manage?
We heavily focus on Open Source projects (eg: Wazuh, OpenSearch, NGINX, NextCloud, Odoo, Kubernetes among others), but we are open to hear what you want to accomplish. If we can do it, we do it. If we can't, we can't. We can eventually manage Office365 tenants and so on depending on your userbase.

## Do you do development work?
No. We don't do big development projects and we are not developers. We can do little integrations or scripts with `Python`, `Shell` or `Go`, but we won't offer development projects (at least for now).

## Will I have a dedicated person?
Yes. Or no. Every project is different and you may have one or multiple people working on your environments simultaneously.
